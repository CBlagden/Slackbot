Orange County I think for sure
I make the bold proposal of us doing only 2
it will save money, and maybe we will work smarter
We got to champs at Arizona with Chairman's, and would've received the default wildcard as Alliance Captain at LA anyway
Agree with lemus,  OC for sure.  Then well see,  maybe lancaster?  Might be tough to even get 3 events with lottery.  2nd event may need to be travel distance. 
If we do choose to go to any during week 2, no Rosary girls can come due to Red and Gold
I couldn't go to Arizona because of Red and Gold
Week 2 2018? Good to know
Good to know,  Krista,  we will definitely need to consider that.  That is one reason more regionals is helpful especially with the team size increasing.  If we go to 3,  hopefully all students would be able to make at least 2 events as they dodge conflicts.
True about 3. Hmm. 
Also costs more,  but with more students,  maybe we can raise more funds to support 3. Ight be tough to get nearby events with lottery,  maybe addition of lancaster will help.
Red and Gold typically always lands on the 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of March (since it goes on for two days a Friday and a Saturday) every year at Servite's theater. We have some Saturday practices beforehand, but we start practicing Monday-Friday beginning January.

rip saved money haha 
lol there goes my money for headphones
or just go to “different” restaurants instead of fine dining
is team bonding a thing?
I thought off-seasons were for that
Not everyone is able to go to all of the off seasons
If we do choose to go to any during week 2, no Rosary girls can come due to Red and Gold
I couldn't go to Arizona because of Red and Gold
Week 2 2018? Good to know
Good to know,  Krista,  we will definitely need to consider that.  That is one reason more regionals is helpful especially with the team size increasing.  If we go to 3,  hopefully all students would be able to make at least 2 events as they dodge conflicts.
True about 3. Hmm. 
Also costs more,  but with more students,  maybe we can raise more funds to support 3. Ight be tough to get nearby events with lottery,  maybe addition of lancaster will help.
Red and Gold typically always lands on the 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of March (since it goes on for two days a Friday and a Saturday) every year at Servite's theater. We have some Saturday practices beforehand, but we start practicing Monday-Friday beginning January.

I make the bold proposal of us doing only 2
it will save money, and maybe we will work smarter
We got to champs at Arizona with Chairman's, and would've received the default wildcard as Alliance Captain at LA anyway
Agree with lemus,  OC for sure.  Then well see,  maybe lancaster?  Might be tough to even get 3 events with lottery.  2nd event may need to be travel distance.

it is actually possible to filter info the bot reads
<@U2AU08KK9> the censorbot was a random idea for the students channel but if we find that it could be useful...

Oh, ask Josh! He knows...
Thank you
Oh right
its swift sir
Yes mr blagden
i think its called swerve, suave...
Does anybody know what programming language they use on those iPhones?
requirement
dinunzio must start teaching swift
was at google io
improved version of java, very clean, easy to port over to
swift
google is trying to push kotlin
There is a reason why google is looking to switch from java to a more modern language 
much wow
very modern
imo everything should be in swift
then make it in swift
the bot isn't in swift, is it boi?
thats why its superior
<@U124KTUMB> if you give me a list of offensive words i can
this is swift syntax
fix your syntax karson
if isSexist == true {

} 
preferably any sexist words

Lol <@U2AU08KK9> could you make a bot that removes words from people’s messages 
Alex's Ascension (2017-???)

#2019alexisking
#2019operator
God bless Alex, and the bot will not be there.
And our boy Alex is in there 
no bot 
I talked with people today about that before the channel was created
Agreed. Its important that the student channel makes a good first impression on new members so they don't think slack is spam.
Yes
The student channel needs to be memeless
Don't need Hogue or someone complaining or spreading jokes inappropriately
Let's keep the students channel as clean as possible btw

He sent another one 
joseph albano
Well what was this email
i thought he just bcc us
arent you
youre the class of 2020
Lmao. I hope our computers for engineering don't get wiped. Lmao
Well then it’s not an all school email 
idk it just said 2020
If it is an all school email than I think we all got it
What all school email 
anyone else get that all school email
I’m surprised IT didn’t clear my school computer 
I doubt 
Maybe IT backs up teachers lol
Yup
Lol rip APCS 
Like they do to students
IT did 
So he cleared the computer or IT cleared it? 
But it’s informational lol
I’m sorry for this long SHORT story 
So he will just make stuff up until he rewrites everything
He just doesn’t have any teacher lessons or material
He can still assign problems on classroom
I guess so lol
So you guys no longer have homework until he finds something again 
So low key he has to learn every lesson again
And he doesn’t have a backup of any of his files
And said he couldn’t assign our weekend homework
He was pissed this weekend about that
So basically his computer got cleared and he got locked out
He tried to go back to IT and the guy was gone until Monday
when he tried to enter his password.
So he locked his computer (closed the screen) and brought it back to his classroom and couldn’t get into the computer
Lol I hope he knows that it’s going to take 20 years to open inventor on that computer 
So he though it was just a desktop issue
When he got it back he got to temporarily see the computer and the desktop icons were cleared
So I learned that dinunzio sent his computer to IT last Friday to get Autodesk inventor

Rip cad
nooo
Glasses too thin and shiny and not the right size
We scanned some pretty cool stuff tho
It didn’t work
Jon asks if you scanned the glasses
oh cool
And it detects pressure by your hand onto the pad
They advertise 2000 points of contact or some shit like that
But it’s still good
It’s not like Apple Pencil excellent
It’s good
is the stylus like Apple Pencil good?
Smith and I were like what????
We were brainstorming what to bring to competitions and he’s like grenades
Dinunzio was cracking jokes the whole time some were pretty messed up lol
Shit I spelled it backwards
Wow
That is amazing
Which is the goal of it
And when you use the stylus it feels like paper
Yes
Wait, there's a projector on the monitor?!?!
He actually has a funny sense of humor lol
:p
Especially with big daddy dinunzio 
It was fun
ooh shiny

Thank you Andrew 
successfully got rid of the archives
everyone was kicked out of short and should no longer have access to its archives
we could all get in trouble individually get in trouble for screenshot content 
This is obviously to do with the memes in short chat
<!channel> I would like to reiterate what Andrew said earlier when he switched up team boding and the short chat. I asked him to move stuff and archive short due to potential privacy concerns with what we say. if we say something that its offensive, keep it to direct messages or at least without people present that would be whistle-blowers
Good thing you bring that up Karson 
We should probably chill on the krista memes

TeamBonding - Created by Liz and Controlled by Krista 
Well potentially the messages we post in the short channel can be shown to a mentor
What does that even mean " privacy concerns "
Just use tall lol
I know but it’s for privacy concerns
Sadness 
...
Well it looks like Krista wanted it under her control 
<!channel> We have to archive the #short channel and create a new team bonding channel. This new channel will be exclusively team bonding discussion and will include any members interested in team bonding Saturdays or events. Please make sure to keep any other discussion out of that chat for privacy concerns. I will add everyone that is currently in #short.

I will go about this a bit later today to make sure everyone knows and won’t freak out :p

Oh ok 
Martin is getting a little mad cause of the apparent lack of progress 
some gui and sketchy functions
What’s still “rough” 
Thank you 
still rough around the edges
I can try
Chase can you submit the app to the android store today 
almost done
Update on android? 
rip
Karson we have a meeting with Mr. Martin today 
Ok 
we'll need to configure the app on someone else's phone beforehand
For both of you guys, can we test out attendance this Friday even though I doubt any of us will be there? 
My friend can test for the iPhone 5S 
Karson I can test for iPhone 6, Lemus could do iPhone 7, and you have a 6+ so there’s 3 devices already 
Great :+1: 
i can get a selection of friends
There’s gotta be some competent students with S8’s, S7’s, S6’s, a moto of some sort, some random HTC flagship, and idk Huawei and Xiaomi devices 
I think Jon would be willing to beta test for the pixel 
Karson find at least 1 person per iPhone newer than the iPhone 5 
i have access to both
i'll try it on nexus and samsung devices
Also (for chase) get a nice mix of various android devices, newest and some old ones people commonly use still 
Same with you karson 
Chase can you find a (rather large) select group of people to beta test the app like this weekend? 
we need to meet our deadline!!!
where are we at with both apps
thanks
I shared a folder will all the updated assets for the asylum App 
Chase check your email 
Fixed the cable and now my iPhone is alive 
Ok rip
My cable is totally fucked now and my phone is at 1% so I’ll se you at Starbucks 
Yup
That’s how we roll 
Yes 
Even events that we need to go to
Put everything on hold for a rosary event
Of course

God forbid anything were to occur during a rosary event 
Need to check the calendar for a rosary event

Oh you’re working?
i couldn't go till 5
Ok
Are you both down to go to a starbucks or something tomorrow to finish the app?
it's just very weird to say that aggressively at high school students
I still feel like the head ref was out of line for saying "If you argue, we'll DQ you"
not even surprised
SG4
I just looked at the rules from the game manual from the vex forums
Driver Controlled Period. A Pin or Trap is officially over once the Pinning Robot has moved away and the Robots are separated by at least 2 feet (approximately one (1) foam tile). After ending a Pin or Trap, a Robot may not Pin or Trap the same Robot again for a duration of 5 seconds; if a Team does pin the same Robot again, the pinning count will resume from where it left off when the pinning Robot initially backed off.  Minor violations of this rule that do not affect the match will result in a warning. Match Affecting offenses will result in a Disqualification.  Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a Disqualification at the Head Referee's discretion. There is no penalty for Pinning during the Autonomous Period
Wtf is this

Not really, but tradeoff with travel costs for members instead.  Plan is to do wk 4 then 6 then try foe wk 2.  CVR an option, not too much travel, but Aero will likely require travel/hotel stay.

Yes we can help. We have a dolly. 
We will be here at 7:20 can we get some help unloading 
Who's on their way?
We are at Damien and unloaded. 
Thinking about our regional lottery signup this week.  If we 1st pick aerospace, 2nd pick LA, with Aerospace as our waitlist option, we would either get aerospace or waitlist it.  Since LA is already full.  Scenario 2: 1st Aero, 2nd CVR, we might get into Aero or CVR (since neither are full), both week 6.  I'm a bit worried that we made it to OCR so we may have a lower priority since the order is reversed and we may not survive the aerospace waitlist process.  thoughts?

Due to the fire today,  air is very bad at school wit smoke.  Administration is bringing students inside.  Robotics will still meet, but will stay only in the classroom .  Please contact your student and arrange.for them to come home early at your discussion.  Also note that 91 in Anaheim hills area is closed and surrounding traffic is jammed.  I will stay in the classroom as long as parents are ok with their students staying or until 8pm.
What a fantastic event we pulled off.  I heard so many compliments about how the Friarbots supported the event.  You all should be proud about  what we made happen.  We have one last opportunity to explore.  We rent the official FIRST field from our San Diego FIRST representative, but the electronics are rented from the Cheesy Poofs team 254, who built it for Chezy Champs.  We took all the stuff back in our trailer from Chezy.  The chezy arena equipment needs to be back next week and we are looking for a way to get the 16 totes and a couple boxes back to San Jose.  If anyone is planning on driving that way, please let me know if  you would mind taking some extra stuff.  We would pay for gas and even rent a van for you to use if necessary.  If you know of another reasonable way of getting the equipment there,  please let me know.
While tearing down the pit we found a friarbots t-shirt size adult large, and Snapchat spectacles. Anyone missing theirs?
We need students to help with practice field breakdown and then pit. Parents are welcome to help.
we lost :cry::cry::cry:
How are we doing?
1661 needs some attention please help them check power to Rio. Radio stayed up Rio went down. 
<@U14B3TBL4> hi diane

az north 4 life
Yes
oh, AZ west if we get LA to avoid three in a row
Ok, the plan is good
more complicated that I noted, but didn't want it to get confusing.
AZ west is week 6  maybe if we don't get Aerospace valley right.
Back up for week 6
AZ West?
We met today to discuss regional selections.  Outcome is 1st round:  OCR only to assure we at least get wait listed, 2nd round Aerospace Valley then LA.  shooting for AZ North or maybe SD on unrestricted round for a 3 regional season, weeks 2-4-6.  comments anyone?
New FRC Blog Post: <https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/blog/event-preferences-update> Title:  Event Preferences Update
I'm not sure, just know NASA was restricted.  If any require use on regional registration, we'll have to look closely to see if they can be combined with Boeing grant.
Good to know. Any other grants on James' list we aren't eligible for?
We can not get both Boeing and Nasa grants.  Fyi
Ok
I believe in person discussion with regard to regionals will resume Monday, but nothing is planned as of yet 
we are still working out what events to go to
<!channel> are we considering going to the Aerospace Valley Regional? The NASA grant for veteran's requires us to participate in a new regional to elevate the quality of the event and competition.

Sounds good. I'd like to get a date on the calendar so new members can plan to come and be a part of Chairman's, funding and outreach. 
let's sit down tomorrow and work out some date options.  We need to do new member stuff also (VEX kickoff, safety training, etc)  We should make sure to engage some new members in the chairmans process as well.
Let's get a meeting on the calendar to kick off. 
so shoot for a few meetings in Sept/Oct where you set deadlines in November thru February for all three of those
general starting point for chairman's, woodie flowers, and dean's list is Nov. 1st
:thumbsup_all: 
<@U2AU1J3J9> <@U124KTUMB> work with Mrs Kane on scheduling this. I will of course help on Chairman's but you are the project managers now

I hears back from HP this morning.  They are working with us on our submission.  I think we are ok and they will accept our grant submission.  Ill keep you updated.
I’ll do h.264, and QuickTime formats in 1080p and 720p if necessary 
located under outreach on the shared folder
The finished essay for the Sprout grant is on the drive currently if anyone would like to view it
<@U124KTUMB>, you might have the video file in a couple formats if that's easy for you in case we have constraints or problems uploading tomorrow.  Also be prepared to adjust resolution in case file size restrictions are imposed.  I didn't see any guidance in the application, but just to be safe, bring the tools to modify quickly if you can.
Oh okay yeah that's definitely possible
if we can get the HP grant final version out tonight (after you have managed your homework/studying), we can have reviews tomorrow and final scrub at tomorrow's robotics meeting and submit before 8pm in case the timer  for submittal is on the east coast (11pm there)
did you see the markups/comments I made on the grant outline page you had on Satuday or was that Thursday?
yea, read back now, sorry, was offline most of the day spending time with Mrs. Smith
They are 
Are they on this slack channel?
Confirmesd due 10/2
Or rather, Mr Smith, you should go through Matt and Brandon for the final versions of all aspects of the submission
I'm getting the draft from <@U2AU1J3J9> 
Just checked it's due tomorrow. 
Ill check again
But would be nice if we had it for final review before.
I thought it was due today. 
Due tomorrow
Send me the final and i will complete the submission.

<@U124VG02W> <@U2AU1J3J9> <@U124KTUMB> did we get the HP grant completed and submitted?
<@U659QH1J5> and <@U3LHA8YAK> thanks for your help on the Actuonix grant :thumbsup:

Thanks,  mrs Kane!
Just submitted the Actuonix grant request. 
I've added comments on the sprout grant outline page.  Also shared with Mr. Dinunzio
I have the cover letter but need to add awards and video links then PDF it. 
<@U659QH1J5> did you put that Actuonix passage on the 3309 folder?
<@U2AU1J3J9> <@U124VG02W> can one of you send me a list of our awards for the Actuonix sponsorship?
Are the essay answers shared anywhere so we can review?
Sounds good :+1: :white_check_mark: 
I haven't been home since I left robotics as I was at a cousins house so I was unable to continue on it. I will work on it again when I get home in about 20 mins. should have it finished around 5:30-6:15
Great team work, thanks!
okay great, thank you
Working on the script atm 
<@U2AU1J3J9> make sure that you have a finished draft by tonight of the write up and the visual aid for Matt to make in illustrator

can you send me a link so I can try this before the apple grant is submitted?

I'll be at Robotics in a few. I'll see who can help. 
There’s a grant due on Sunday (10/1) for Actuonix. It’s a one page sheet that should only take 10 min. tops. Anyone want to do it?
971 has both NASA and apple, but since we're a house team NASA sponsorship is a bit different.
If you get too much sponsorship in Tim's, there's a process to fill out a 409 form. It's as good as cash donation 
good to know, maybe apple is not restricted then.  I was asking David to find out if we can not aply the Boeing grant to our registration payment to allow Apple to cover.  Certianly worth a try. I can give Mitch the info to submit.  maybe I'll hear from David today.
I know a team that has received both nasa and apple
Google doc 
suggestion?
Sure, It's hard to manage by phone but if that works for everyone then I'll make it work. 
can we add a card for each on the fundraising trello board?
Ok cool. Can we get a sheet together if what's in process and who is working on what?
we have lock on Apple alumni who already agreed to submit for grant, but I have question in to CA FIRST director to find out if we can have both Boeing and Apple grants (may be same story as Nasa grant)
I just know from prior experiences that both companies can provide sponsorship to FRC teams if you know someone who works there
Who has the Apple grant info? I have an old co-worker that works for Apple. 
<@U13ACNVA9> do you have a link or additional information?
Mr. Badzey works for their satellite division I believe, and the Barfields have a cousin who also knows Mr. Badzey but not exactly in the same division
the Badzeys and the Barfields both have connections to Northrop
<@U03B3Q2PC> can you send a team email asking if anyone knows someone at Lockheed or Northrop?
If anyone knows someone at Lockheed Martin/Northrup Grumman you can get sponsorship

Grant for the HP Sprout Pro comes out Monday.  I'll post the link, but will involve a video 2-3 min, one 8.5x11 page info sheet and some other basic info.
sorry if this is a repeat post, but we can only receive one grant from either Boeing or Nasa.  they are both restricted grants.

I guess it wouldnt hurt to apply
3997 is from texas and sponsored by them, probably others. Most other teams are from bay though.
Doesn't say that though 
Even intuitive surgical might only sponsor teams in the Bay area :/
Thanks James
some may be bay-area specific as a result. I think we should avoid BWC for this reason
I was talking to someone from a team at chezy champs who offered to send me a list
idk if its for us tho
or printer
if we want a projector

<@U0386L6JY> where did you find all these grants?
<@U154NTNCB> has left the channel
Yes love it!! Need $!$$$
lol
k
sounds great lol
Should I make an account and get started on the intuitive grant then?
I doubt we have an account.
Qualcomm, Brin Wojcicki are other ones that teams get, hard to find the aplications though
do we have an account for the intuitive or do we need to make one?
some other ideas above ^
intuitive is due 10/23

That sounds cool 
Woah what 
checking how fast a robot moves across the field and moving robot icons across a field on the touch pad.
andrew has some videos and images we used for our presentations, maybe he will post here.
Cycle timing?
some did ok, minimum size was an issue on most of them and we didn't have time to do the hires scan.  some nice tools to use for cycle timing.
Besides the glasses 
Scans turn out ok?
Oh cool 
some 3d printed sensor mounts from 2016, butterfly hood gear spanner, glasses (no joy on this, either too shiny or pieces were too narrow to register), skull they had, wood prototypes from 2017 gear intake, slide wheel from 2015, screw fuel feeder prototype, that's about it
What did we try to scan?
We had a great day with the HP Sprout Pro.  What a unique device.  Displays were very sharp, touchscreens, scanning was a bit clunky and required a certian minimum size wich was odd.  hi def scanning took a long time, so we didn't play with it that much.   Andrew did great presenting the ideas we developed.  Grant info will arrive Monday and we have one week to respond and it requires a video.  Let's chat at Monday
<@U2AUFT1C2> has joined the channel
If you have something for us to bring, just leave it in robodome and we will pick it up tomorrow morning 7:30
lets bring the glasses style you are interested in tomorrow.
ez money
But for the part where we scan stuff
Sure it can do _more_ than modeling
So this is just using one of the fantastic aspects of the Sprout Pro
We need to 3D print a set of glasses for a nother project and the cad design is super tough lately because of all the intricate curves 
Ya black tape good idea 
We could just wrap the glasses with matte black tape.really nicely
Well yes I'm just killing two birds with one stone here
Like perhaps drawing on a video to do a post mortem on a match
And think about how you can bring different things together
Focus on more than just 3d scanning
Also, keep in mind the sprout is a multi-function device
Keep mind the reflectivity of the lensesiht make it really hard to scan, I just don't know, but have backup ideas.
talk about making 3D modeling so much easier
What if we use the sprout pro to scan those sunglasses!
Oh Mr Smith we had an awesome idea at school this morning
Perhaps some sensor or connector that doesn't have a virtual part online
E.g. let's say we wanted to CAD out a mount for a phone, having a digital version of the phone to cad around would be super useful, but if there is no 1:1 model of the phone out there, just scan it
One of the best uses of a 3D scanner for us would be to take a physical part we have that we need to add to the robot cad in inventor *where no digital version exists*
More last minute guidance from David Berggren regarding event....Below please find information, from the HP trainer, regarding team resources you all may want to consider 

In the afternoon, teams will be completing a "design challenge" to apply what they learned about the Sprout in the morning session to a robotics-focused design-thinking activity that could be used by their team. The goal is for teams to be able to create something they can take away and use; with this we are asking teams to bring any items they feel they may need for that. We realize this is a little tricky because they don't know the Sprout yet so probably have no idea what they want to work on during the design time... and therefore don't know what to bring! We hope with the ideas below they will be able to think of some resources to bring to help their team with the design challenge.

Some ideas for the design time that were brainstormed include:
Create a digital documentation plan for your season that incorporates the Sprouts documentation methods (Capture, Video Capture, Stage, Stop Motion, Camera 3D).
Create a plan and schedule for virtual mentoring using Sprouts collaboration platform.
Use the 3D scanning programs to scan a robotics part and bring the scan into various programs for use in collaboration. 
Create a branding and Marketing plan for your season using the Sprout.
Create a fundraising plan and create fundraising marketing using the Sprout.

Team Resource Ideas: Robot parts they may want to scan and prototype, marketing materials, documentation/plans for their fundraising this year...
Following the field layout idea,  we could draw paths on the desktop image and animate a sample robot to simulate cycles and optimize cycle times for strategies.   
<@U124KTUMB> ,  please elaborate on easier video editing idea.
How about a simple hex hub?

Sorry for the sporadic attention.  Here is the agenda for the session so you can customize responses.  Not sure how the teams will be selected, but i imagine whoever comes up with the most innovative or clever application that will male the device invaluable.  Love the field idea,  they should have cad loaded on the machine.  Lets bring some clay,  i have some playdough we could try. As for parts,  we could bring some sensor mounts like 2016 hood sensor.  Trunnion is good one.  We could bring our robot cad and try to fit a part by scanning or sketching it out.  Keep them coming.
<@U2AU08KK9> has joined the channel
And a fairlane which we have easily accessible 
yeah
That we 3D printed a ton of
I was thinking the spacer for the phone
We could even find that 2014 trunion
Pretty thin
Plates work too for the gear intake
I think other teams will bring fuel, thats an obvious one. For us, we should find something small on our robot that was really important this season.  What about the MOI (white powdercoat) or the fairlane or a drivetrain wheel with tread?
Now, that's generally speaking doesn't 3D scanning, some are better and some are worse about it. I have no idea how good this one is
Matte powder coat would probably work okay, though it it's too flat and one color, especially black, that can cause an issue too, basically it needs to have visual features it can lock onto and track
There's some matte parts we made
We already have some
Can we get some Matte powder
Coat?
how about something we powdercoated? or still too shiny?
man, that 3D scanner is pretty swanky.  I wonder how well it'll work on objects with high specular / reflective surfaces (probably not well)
Yes,  we can bring in parts to scan.  Acxorsing to Dave Berggren,  shiny parts have problems,  so any other suggestions?
bring in a prop u kno
like maybe that strafe gearbox from 2015 or something
Kenny found this video, if it works like this we could bring in a part
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKwHYvtsFE>
Right, so we would add more to the two questions from our original application: 1. How can you imagine Sprout Pro being used by your team before and during the 2018 FRC Season? 2. Please tell us one unique fact about your team.
like builkding off what we wrote
feel like we need to show how we can use it effecitvley
If we're the most enthusiastic? Or wat
Right how do they choose us as one of the 3
“Oh wow video editing will be so much easier” 
The only thing in the demonstrations that could make us is the part where they do Adobe Products 
"After you attend the exploratory session, you will be eligible to apply for the HP Sprout Tech &amp; Grant Package worth $5,300 and become one of three Sprout Pro pilot teams."
Oh so how do we win it? Just be like "OH WOW THATS SO USEFUL" over and over?
Chezy Champs Update and Exciting Opportunity with HP 
didnt see the email
got it
It looks like the day is just a bunch of demonstrations of what it can do based on the email  
what is happening
what is this
I guess the field can be opened by other CAD programs too, maybe it would work right away on whatever software comes with the sprout.
so you would draw the robot on the sprout table, or model the robot, and then scan it directly into the field
I think a cool idea would be to use the full-field CAD and insert a robot prototype *into* the field
if it's the kind of thing where we are trying to impress the HP reps, would we be allowed to install inventor?
so what will we be trying to do at this event
If the thing has a good 3D scanner. Time to break out the clay, get students modeling things. Then digitizing and 3D printing them back out... Turn this STEM into some STEAM!
We’re getting a Sprout Pro or are we considering one?

Is there an address that I can share google.photos group with that includes all the 3309 shared folder group?
at least we could upload them at original resolution to the gdrive photos account.
bummer, seems this should be better for google by not copying them outside of gdrive to get them into photos when they are already storing the photos on gdrive.  interesting.
No
looks like we cannot drag between gdrive and photos, would like to use photos as the viewer/organizer and store the photos on gdrive and keep them where they are currently located, is this possible?
any process where we can upload to photos from gdrive folders?
can other's upload photos directly from our google drive?
You can share with link. Another account to log into sounds complicated
Easier just to make a shared album probably
if need be, we could create a <mailto:photos@team3309.org|photos@team3309.org> account that everyone can access to upload photos
not sure what the intent of that icon on the screen print, seems it would be a group account.  I'll try some on my account and see how it works.

I was looking for a group account version so anyone can create categories.
let me try that method, I was using the icon you see on the screenshot

looks like it should be enabled, when I go to <http://photos.google.com|photos.google.com> from my @team3309.org it loads up. can you screenshot what you see?
update to message:  "Stay Tuned! Your photos are coming soon."
Oh let me see if I need to enable it 
Is this an education thing
<@U0386EA7C> 
just put them in the media folder.  at some point I will setup a google photos account.  trying to see if it will be implimented on our team account, maybe <@U0386L6JY> can find out if/when photos will be part of our team google account.  there is an icon there, but when you select it, it displays message that "coming soon".
Thanks Matt

<@U124KTUMB> <@U124VG02W> <@U2AUFT1C2> can one of you answer Mrs Colby on their Slack Friarbots channel about today?
Thank goodness, it's so scary to have fires so close. Take care and hopefully they are able to get it out soon. 
We are safe. We are on the North Side of Greenriver. The south side is what got hit with fire. These brave firefighters have been going non stop since fire broke out. It will take a week to get fire out. This is what they are saying. Helicopters and planes constantly overhead placing fire retardant and water down along the hillsides. We feel very safe. 
Thanks for asking Karen. 
I can go 
Oh no, hope he's better soon. How's the fire in your area?
Thanks 

Okay, hope he feels better
Brandon is home sick today 

and karson
and matt
Brandon, are you available to go to Friends today
I'm so glad you are able to be there on Wednesdays. I'm sure the team appreciates the help. Thanks for making it happen. 
It's going excellent on Wednesdays! I love helping the girls and also do the other Rosary girls. I gather around 5 girls to come help me out. Not all 5 come at once so they switch off while I take them there
How's it going on Wednesdays? How many girls are going?
Has to be a couple of the boys since girls are coming on Wednesdays now to help with the 8th grade all-girls team
<!channel> we owe Mrs Colby an answer this morning on who is going to Friends today to mentor. We need to send at least two people. Who is available?
<@U2AU1J3J9> hope the fire isn't too close, stay safe. I hope you start feeling better soon. 
Hope all is well with your family and house! Get well.
I wasn't able to go today cause of the fire  situation, and I probably won't make it Thursday too. Plus I am getting sick. 
<@U2AU1J3J9> <@U124VG02W> did anyone go to Friends today? Mrs Colby is asking for help this week on her Slack channel.

Hi guys....it's probably the wrong channel to ask in....but how are we on ropes? Anything need to be fixed?
🛴 🛴 
That sounds like a good idea kenny
Scouters*
Scooters any thoughts?
I was thinking like one or two of their students could basically join our scouting team
What needs to happen at Bb for us to help them effectively
I'm for it personally, too
it's in the spirit of good competition. Great if the 6th alliance makes better picks and you help, even if you're the 3rd alliance and playing against them
me too! at Chezy, 3476 gave "pit access" to several teams (unexpected alliance captains, for example)
I think we should
And they will too 
But we don’t want to I totally get it 
They can see how a higher tier team scouts and get data 
I think if one or two of their kids joined out scouting team that would be a really cool thing 
Ya teams share. But they work together 
Andrew is correct 
I'm just curious if it's something teams typically share. I like the idea of helping them scout. 
I think they are asking for scouting data we get at Bb
Are they asking for CC scouting data or the app itself to track their own data
They can get a chance to see how we do it 
We can make some of their kids scout 
We don’t have too 
They just don’t have enough kids there 
flag_gp
:flag-gp: 
Gracious Professionalism?  
Why would we share our data?
But sure. Saikiran will say yes
It's our data...
should we ask Code Orange if it's ok for us to share also, aren't we using their tool?
we could offer "access in the pit" on Sunday for example
with hobbesthescout running on it
it's extremely hard to share unless we set up a <http://team3309.org|team3309.org> subdomain
Would be a good opportunity for them to learn how we scout as well 
Is there somthing we can work out?
They only have 12 kids coming 
Hey so circuit of life is asking if they can have our scouting data for bb

Unfortunately,  the Connelly alliance did not win.  It was a well run event for a first year event.

We are going to a third match.
Connellys alliance takes the first match after a long controversy!
Rosary receives the Judges award,  congratulations Rosary!
Connelly Coders move on to the Finals!
Team A lost a tough battle against the 1st Place alliance in the semifinals.  Great effort all day from both teams.  Congratulations Friarbots.
Team B did not get picked, but are taking advantage of the time and working on their robot to get ready for next week.
Team A qualified 7th.  Team A 5th alliance captain.
Now
When do alliance selections start?
Both teams head to the practice field for some final tweaking before alliance selections.
