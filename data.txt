Week 2 2018? Good to know
Good to know,  Krista,  we will definitely need to consider that.  That is one reason more regionals is helpful especially with the team size increasing.  If we go to 3,  hopefully all students would be able to make at least 2 events as they dodge conflicts.
True about 3. Hmm. 
Also costs more,  but with more students,  maybe we can raise more funds to support 3. Ight be tough to get nearby events with lottery,  maybe addition of lancaster will help.
Red and Gold typically always lands on the 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of March (since it goes on for two days a Friday and a Saturday) every year at Servite's theater. We have some Saturday practices beforehand, but we start practicing Monday-Friday beginning January.

"Who's on First"

(Lou Costello is considering becoming a ballplayer. Bud Abbott wants to make sure he knows what he's getting into.)



Abbott: Strange as it may seem, they give ball players nowadays very peculiar names.

Costello: Funny names?

Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--

Costello: That's what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.

Abbott: I'm telling you. Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third--

Costello: You know the fellows' names?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: Well, then who's playing first?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: I mean the fellow's name on first base.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The fellow playin' first base.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy on first base.

Abbott: Who is on first.

Costello: Well, what are you askin' me for?

Abbott: I'm not asking you--I'm telling you. Who is on first.

Costello: I'm asking you--who's on first?

Abbott: That's the man's name.

Costello: That's who's name?

Abbott: Yes.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?

Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man's entitled to it.

Costello: Who is?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: So who gets it?

Abbott: Why shouldn't he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.

Costello: Who's wife?

Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.

Costello: Who does?

Abbott: Absolutely.

Costello: Well, all I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base?

Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott: Who's on first!

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?

Abbott: Oh, absolutely.

Costello: The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: I don't know, I just thought I'd ask.

Abbott: Well, I just thought I'd tell you.

Costello: Then tell me who's playing left field?

Abbott: Who's playing first.

Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: Because.

Abbott: Oh, he's center field.

Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?

Abbott: Wouldn't this be a fine team w i t h o u t a pitcher?

Costello: Tell me the pitcher's name.

Abbott: Tomorrow.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball--me being a good catcher--I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?

Abbott: Now, that's he first thing you've said right.

Costello: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

Abbott: Don't get excited. Take it easy.

Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don't know. I don't know throws it back to tomorrow--a triple play.

Abbott: Yeah, it could be.

Costello: Another guy gets up and it's a long ball to center.

Abbott: Because.

Costello: Why? I don't know. And I don't care.

Abbott: What was that?

Costello: I said, I DON'T CARE!

Abbott: Oh, that's our shortstop!

Well what was this email
i thought he just bcc us
arent you
youre the class of 2020
Lmao. I hope our computers for engineering don't get wiped. Lmao
Well then it’s not an all school email 
idk it just said 2020
If it is an all school email than I think we all got it
What all school email 
anyone else get that all school email
I’m surprised IT didn’t clear my school computer 
I doubt 
Maybe IT backs up teachers lol
Yup
Lol rip APCS 
Like they do to students
IT did 
So he cleared the computer or IT cleared it? 
But it’s informational lol
I’m sorry for this long SHORT story 
So he will just make stuff up until he rewrites everything
He just doesn’t have any teacher lessons or material
He can still assign problems on classroom
I guess so lol
So you guys no longer have homework until he finds something again 
So low key he has to learn every lesson again
And he doesn’t have a backup of any of his files
And said he couldn’t assign our weekend homework
He was pissed this weekend about that
So basically his computer got cleared and he got locked out
He tried to go back to IT and the guy was gone until Monday
when he tried to enter his password.
So he locked his computer (closed the screen) and brought it back to his classroom and couldn’t get into the computer
Lol I hope he knows that it’s going to take 20 years to open inventor on that computer 
So he though it was just a desktop issue
When he got it back he got to temporarily see the computer and the desktop icons were cleared
So I learned that dinunzio sent his computer to IT last Friday to get Autodesk inventor

is the stylus like Apple Pencil good?
Smith and I were like what????
We were brainstorming what to bring to competitions and he’s like grenades
Dinunzio was cracking jokes the whole time some were pretty messed up lol
Shit I spelled it backwards
Wow
That is amazing
Which is the goal of it
And when you use the stylus it feels like paper
Yes
Wait, there's a projector on the monitor?!?!
He actually has a funny sense of humor lol

Thank you Andrew 
successfully got rid of the archives
everyone was kicked out of short and should no longer have access to its archives
we could all get in trouble individually get in trouble for screenshot content 
This is obviously to do with the memes in short chat
<!channel> I would like to reiterate what Andrew said earlier when he switched up team boding and the short chat. I asked him to move stuff and archive short due to potential privacy concerns with what we say. if we say something that its offensive, keep it to direct messages or at least without people present that would be whistle-blowers

Well potentially the messages we post in the short channel can be shown to a mentor
What does that even mean " privacy concerns "
Just use tall lol
I know but it’s for privacy concerns
Sadness 
...
Well it looks like Krista wanted it under her control 
<!channel> We have to archive the #short channel and create a new team bonding channel. This new channel will be exclusively team bonding discussion and will include any members interested in team bonding Saturdays or events. Please make sure to keep any other discussion out of that chat for privacy concerns. I will add everyone that is currently in #short.

I will go about this a bit later today to make sure everyone knows and won’t freak out :p

Ok good idea

And should we cat since it will take a week anyway
What’s the bot at
Like Siri and James
Alexa is the forgotten sister who lives on a consumer server not industrial grade equipment 
Their wires get twisted all the time
Actually it should interrupt every exciting moment with an FTC match to prolong the excitement obviously 
what about alexa?
Same cloud server
They live together 
They are good friends
not the google assisstant?
Siri wrote that for me 
James Carr give me one tomorrow James Carr and James Carr and James Carr a give me what you want to do things James Carr told James Carr what you doing today is my day
Don’t you want me
9%
And then picks a random games
Lol
<@U2AU08KK9> have the bot interject every argument with “Let’s Go FIRST”
Chase what percent?

its too late for that now
How about we have the bot create memes for the dinunzio picture at a rate of 1 per minute
like every 5 minutes
A bot for the bot, so to speak
Can you do automatic bot updates 
What’s the bot at?
Blanche to that.
jawn lawgrippa

When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
酷く痛む 鼓動は早く
遠のく景色を この手で掴もうとした
They are the weakest
They don’t even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you

<@U03B3Q2PC>Ok I'll be there tomorrow. Is there a meeting tonight?
Not sure,  may only have those with school logo on the shoulder.  You can contact Dave to find out tonight or i can check tomorrow.
<@U3KPX9VN1> do we have a women's DL tshirt? I need one more tshirt for Chezy!
Low key andymark chassis with extra holes
Ri3d
They prob built this one because of that 
It was falling apart at chezy :joy: 
Rip, kinda lookin forward to there regular bot. 
1678 style
No dustpan
Wow, that gear intake looks nice tho
973 is not bringing their real robot to BB

Ok good memory
I think we went down to 28 for dual hopper
Btw 701 is running a whole new drive team
A good meme
:p
rip me
The ad was on the screen and you thought the phone wasn’t working/crashed :joy: 
yeah but i bought it before champs to avoid thea ds
You did!!!
lmao did u use the ad version
Yay, not the ads
I'll bring vysor :smile:
yeah but i remember us having to go way lower to see it from far hopper
maybe daniel remembers
We only changed that one slider tho
Decently
how sure are u
i feel like it was a lower value and a bigger delta than that
We went on field and deemed 32 safe
we needed lower
i swear we tried lower
oh really ok
unless we did dual hopper
39 and 32
it was like 18 or something for dualhopper
We said 32 was lowest we should go at worlds
<@U2AU0HXPF> may remember the value we tried to use at Hopper
32 way too high
And can’t lock onto goal
Shake camera
32 don’t work well
worth a shot maybe
our vision cant find the goal unless we crank the V way down
What do u think of dual hopper <@U0386L6JY> 
nevermind, end of sat
we have a match with them early on
the bot looks solid
Their auto
Of match videos or there auto?
The matches
And someone on our team needs to watch 
We need a video of it tomorrow 
What?
Video or one of our team needs to see
Good
He wants to try one in a practice match tomorrow
Ya that’s probs better if it works 
Asked him for match videos and he said "no this is an off season deal"
Excellent
Center peg and 10 kpa
That don’t rely on hoppers
Ask about any gear and shoot autos
Do it 
If it helps us get 40 
See what they do in a match 
I want our robot to shoot :p
What do u think we do?
Well for a 20 ball hopper to hold 80 balls, I’m impressed
Idk but it packs well
Seems small though
Lol
It like 80
That 20 ball hopper really expands lol
That’s really good 
Not bad tbh
Not auto but shooting
<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7A9UNEV3AUI&amp;feature=youtu.be>
Ok cool
Hes gonna get one
...
...
Lol 
Oh is tomorrow chezy 
But not for two robot auto
To see what they can do
Ya get another video 
Maybe tho
No two robot auto
Ok
Nah
Do u want them to show us tomorrow?
I don’t want to be shooting with them if they are racking up those yellow cards :p
Oh 
That was the only video he had
Has turret
I don’t either 
Ill ask him
lol
I don’t get it 
Lol 
I can’t tell??? lol 
they have like 20 ball hopper
Said its tuning for hopper but wasnt there and had bumpers
That shoots all the balls outside the field 
It’s a 40 ball auto 
That 701 video was confusing
Uhhhh
Ok
Would not recommend duel hopper 
701 hopper auto
<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/355946399495356417/358119526136545280/video.mov>
Gear, preloads then get balls and shoot in tele
All we have to do is make some 
Also the phone freaks out even at 32 threashhold
That shot is super inconsistent and requires too much rps
Other probs didn’t program it 
Our shooter can’t do much that far back
We should really be the close bot in dual hopper
PooinnnttSs
As long as we can get one other gear in auto 
Just hopper counting rules 
Chezy the place to do it 
and maybe the match with 1323
701 said they want to try but idk about doing it with them
Is there even a match to run dual hopper? 
Max when can we do a dual hopper
nvm 7-4 we have 11 matches
971 will rank high too
254 will rank first easy schedule
^
Gotta get that 40. Everytime 
Rip
I hope
5th
prob not lol
Lol
Does that mean we will still rank 2 
6-4 or around there is my guess
:cat2:
<@U14NNU96G> 
Max what are your first impressions 
38 sounds interesting too
So that might be an interesting match 
Q53 we have 5499 
sad
No matches with 254
Lol 
if the tape comes up we could win
Q53 against citrus and space cookies
Vs 3309 1671 115
rip
1323 971 973
:o
Ya lol
Quals 23 is rip
Looks decent to me 
First match we're with 973
Matches out for chezy
I am in UK but will tune in if possible. See y'all at :beachblitz: 
<@U0386EA7C>  will you be there?
3309
1678 
971 973 1323 254 3309
Yeah
Is chezy gonna be crazy competitive this year?
I might come on Sunday
Are you coming Michael? Which days 
Me too bud
I wish I could be there 
Miss u too! 
Awwww Kenny I miss you
Lol 
Yeah I originally thought it was next weekend too <@U349BDYRJ> 
Cool!
Lol rip me
Yup. We will be there tomorrow at 9:00 am. 
Rip kenny
Uhhh
Wait chezy is this weekend 
Maybe 1:30 - 2
Tomorrow
When are you guys coming up to chezy?

Red and Gold typically always lands on the 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of March (since it goes on for two days a Friday and a Saturday) every year at Servite's theater. We have some Saturday practices beforehand, but we start practicing Monday-Friday beginning January.
Also costs more,  but with more students,  maybe we can raise more funds to support 3. Ight be tough to get nearby events with lottery,  maybe addition of lancaster will help.
True about 3. Hmm. 
Good to know,  Krista,  we will definitely need to consider that.  That is one reason more regionals is helpful especially with the team size increasing.  If we go to 3,  hopefully all students would be able to make at least 2 events as they dodge conflicts.
Week 2 2018? Good to know
I couldn't go to Arizona because of Red and Gold
If we do choose to go to any during week 2, no Rosary girls can come due to Red and Gold
Agree with lemus,  OC for sure.  Then well see,  maybe lancaster?  Might be tough to even get 3 events with lottery.  2nd event may need to be travel distance. 
We got to champs at Arizona with Chairman's, and would've received the default wildcard as Alliance Captain at LA anyway
it will save money, and maybe we will work smarter
I make the bold proposal of us doing only 2
Orange County I think for sure

Sounds good. I'd like to get a date on the calendar so new members can plan to come and be a part of Chairman's, funding and outreach. 
let's sit down tomorrow and work out some date options.  We need to do new member stuff also (VEX kickoff, safety training, etc)  We should make sure to engage some new members in the chairmans process as well.
Let's get a meeting on the calendar to kick off. 
so shoot for a few meetings in Sept/Oct where you set deadlines in November thru February for all three of those
general starting point for chairman's, woodie flowers, and dean's list is Nov. 1st
:thumbsup_all: 
<@U2AU1J3J9> <@U124KTUMB> work with Mrs Kane on scheduling this. I will of course help on Chairman's but you are the project managers now

it may also be a good idea to start working on woodie flowers!!

971 has both NASA and apple, but since we're a house team NASA sponsorship is a bit different.
If you get too much sponsorship in Tim's, there's a process to fill out a 409 form. It's as good as cash donation 
good to know, maybe apple is not restricted then.  I was asking David to find out if we can not aply the Boeing grant to our registration payment to allow Apple to cover.  Certianly worth a try. I can give Mitch the info to submit.  maybe I'll hear from David today.
I know a team that has received both nasa and apple
Google doc 
suggestion?
Sure, It's hard to manage by phone but if that works for everyone then I'll make it work. 
can we add a card for each on the fundraising trello board?
Ok cool. Can we get a sheet together if what's in process and who is working on what?
we have lock on Apple alumni who already agreed to submit for grant, but I have question in to CA FIRST director to find out if we can have both Boeing and Apple grants (may be same story as Nasa grant)
I just know from prior experiences that both companies can provide sponsorship to FRC teams if you know someone who works there
Who has the Apple grant info? I have an old co-worker that works for Apple. 
<@U13ACNVA9> do you have a link or additional information?
Mr. Badzey works for their satellite division I believe, and the Barfields have a cousin who also knows Mr. Badzey but not exactly in the same division
the Badzeys and the Barfields both have connections to Northrop
<@U03B3Q2PC> can you send a team email asking if anyone knows someone at Lockheed or Northrop?
If anyone knows someone at Lockheed Martin/Northrup Grumman you can get sponsorship

Grant for the HP Sprout Pro comes out Monday.  I'll post the link, but will involve a video 2-3 min, one 8.5x11 page info sheet and some other basic info.
sorry if this is a repeat post, but we can only receive one grant from either Boeing or Nasa.  they are both restricted grants.
As rookies 
Yes
<!channel> have we previously received a NASA grant?
Have we checked the first site?
<@U2AU08KK9> has joined the channel
I guess it wouldnt hurt to apply
3997 is from texas and sponsored by them, probably others. Most other teams are from bay though.
Doesn't say that though 
Even intuitive surgical might only sponsor teams in the Bay area :/
Thanks James
some may be bay-area specific as a result. I think we should avoid BWC for this reason
I was talking to someone from a team at chezy champs who offered to send me a list
idk if its for us tho
or printer
if we want a projector

Should I make an account and get started on the intuitive grant then?
I doubt we have an account.
Qualcomm, Brin Wojcicki are other ones that teams get, hard to find the aplications though
do we have an account for the intuitive or do we need to make one?

That sounds cool 
Woah what 
checking how fast a robot moves across the field and moving robot icons across a field on the touch pad.
andrew has some videos and images we used for our presentations, maybe he will post here.
Cycle timing?
some did ok, minimum size was an issue on most of them and we didn't have time to do the hires scan.  some nice tools to use for cycle timing.
Besides the glasses 
Scans turn out ok?
Oh cool 
some 3d printed sensor mounts from 2016, butterfly hood gear spanner, glasses (no joy on this, either too shiny or pieces were too narrow to register), skull they had, wood prototypes from 2017 gear intake, slide wheel from 2015, screw fuel feeder prototype, that's about it
What did we try to scan?
We had a great day with the HP Sprout Pro.  What a unique device.  Displays were very sharp, touchscreens, scanning was a bit clunky and required a certian minimum size wich was odd.  hi def scanning took a long time, so we didn't play with it that much.   Andrew did great presenting the ideas we developed.  Grant info will arrive Monday and we have one week to respond and it requires a video.  Let's chat at Monday
<@U2AUFT1C2> has joined the channel
If you have something for us to bring, just leave it in robodome and we will pick it up tomorrow morning 7:30
lets bring the glasses style you are interested in tomorrow.
ez money
But for the part where we scan stuff
Sure it can do _more_ than modeling
So this is just using one of the fantastic aspects of the Sprout Pro
We need to 3D print a set of glasses for a nother project and the cad design is super tough lately because of all the intricate curves 
Ya black tape good idea 
We could just wrap the glasses with matte black tape.really nicely
Well yes I'm just killing two birds with one stone here
Like perhaps drawing on a video to do a post mortem on a match
And think about how you can bring different things together
Focus on more than just 3d scanning
Also, keep in mind the sprout is a multi-function device
Keep mind the reflectivity of the lensesiht make it really hard to scan, I just don't know, but have backup ideas.
talk about making 3D modeling so much easier
What if we use the sprout pro to scan those sunglasses!
Oh Mr Smith we had an awesome idea at school this morning
Perhaps some sensor or connector that doesn't have a virtual part online
E.g. let's say we wanted to CAD out a mount for a phone, having a digital version of the phone to cad around would be super useful, but if there is no 1:1 model of the phone out there, just scan it
One of the best uses of a 3D scanner for us would be to take a physical part we have that we need to add to the robot cad in inventor *where no digital version exists*
More last minute guidance from David Berggren regarding event....Below please find information, from the HP trainer, regarding team resources you all may want to consider 

In the afternoon, teams will be completing a "design challenge" to apply what they learned about the Sprout in the morning session to a robotics-focused design-thinking activity that could be used by their team. The goal is for teams to be able to create something they can take away and use; with this we are asking teams to bring any items they feel they may need for that. We realize this is a little tricky because they don't know the Sprout yet so probably have no idea what they want to work on during the design time... and therefore don't know what to bring! We hope with the ideas below they will be able to think of some resources to bring to help their team with the design challenge.

Some ideas for the design time that were brainstormed include:
Create a digital documentation plan for your season that incorporates the Sprouts documentation methods (Capture, Video Capture, Stage, Stop Motion, Camera 3D).
Create a plan and schedule for virtual mentoring using Sprouts collaboration platform.
Use the 3D scanning programs to scan a robotics part and bring the scan into various programs for use in collaboration. 
Create a branding and Marketing plan for your season using the Sprout.
Create a fundraising plan and create fundraising marketing using the Sprout.

Team Resource Ideas: Robot parts they may want to scan and prototype, marketing materials, documentation/plans for their fundraising this year...
Following the field layout idea,  we could draw paths on the desktop image and animate a sample robot to simulate cycles and optimize cycle times for strategies.   
<@U124KTUMB> ,  please elaborate on easier video editing idea.
How about a simple hex hub?
<@U03B3Q2PC> uploaded a file: <https://team3309.slack.com/files/U03B3Q2PC/F76GQN2Q0/first___sprout_pro_exploratory_session_agenda.pdf|FIRST &amp; Sprout Pro Exploratory Session Agenda.pdf> and commented: Great thoughts!  Sorry for the sporadic attention.  Here is the agenda for the session so you can customize responses.  Not sure how the teams will be selected, but i imagine whoever comes up with the most innovative or clever application that will male the device invaluable.  Love the field idea,  they should have cad loaded on the machine.  Lets bring some clay,  i have some playdough we could try. As for parts,  we could bring some sensor mounts like 2016 hood sensor.  Trunnion is good one.  We could bring our robot cad and try to fit a part by scanning or sketching it out.  Keep them coming.
<@U2AU08KK9> has joined the channel
And a fairlane which we have easily accessible 
yeah
That we 3D printed a ton of
I was thinking the spacer for the phone
We could even find that 2014 trunion
Pretty thin
Plates work too for the gear intake
I think other teams will bring fuel, thats an obvious one. For us, we should find something small on our robot that was really important this season.  What about the MOI (white powdercoat) or the fairlane or a drivetrain wheel with tread?
Now, that's generally speaking doesn't 3D scanning, some are better and some are worse about it. I have no idea how good this one is
Matte powder coat would probably work okay, though it it's too flat and one color, especially black, that can cause an issue too, basically it needs to have visual features it can lock onto and track
There's some matte parts we made
We already have some
Can we get some Matte powder
Coat?
how about something we powdercoated? or still too shiny?
man, that 3D scanner is pretty swanky.  I wonder how well it'll work on objects with high specular / reflective surfaces (probably not well)
Yes,  we can bring in parts to scan.  Acxorsing to Dave Berggren,  shiny parts have problems,  so any other suggestions?
bring in a prop u kno
like maybe that strafe gearbox from 2015 or something
Kenny found this video, if it works like this we could bring in a part
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKwHYvtsFE>
Right, so we would add more to the two questions from our original application: 1. How can you imagine Sprout Pro being used by your team before and during the 2018 FRC Season? 2. Please tell us one unique fact about your team.
like builkding off what we wrote
feel like we need to show how we can use it effecitvley
If we're the most enthusiastic? Or wat
Right how do they choose us as one of the 3
“Oh wow video editing will be so much easier” 
The only thing in the demonstrations that could make us is the part where they do Adobe Products 
"After you attend the exploratory session, you will be eligible to apply for the HP Sprout Tech &amp; Grant Package worth $5,300 and become one of three Sprout Pro pilot teams."
Oh so how do we win it? Just be like "OH WOW THATS SO USEFUL" over and over?
Chezy Champs Update and Exciting Opportunity with HP 
didnt see the email
got it
It looks like the day is just a bunch of demonstrations of what it can do based on the email  
what is happening
what is this
I guess the field can be opened by other CAD programs too, maybe it would work right away on whatever software comes with the sprout.
so you would draw the robot on the sprout table, or model the robot, and then scan it directly into the field
I think a cool idea would be to use the full-field CAD and insert a robot prototype *into* the field
if it's the kind of thing where we are trying to impress the HP reps, would we be allowed to install inventor?
so what will we be trying to do at this event
If the thing has a good 3D scanner. Time to break out the clay, get students modeling things. Then digitizing and 3D printing them back out... Turn this STEM into some STEAM!
We’re getting a Sprout Pro or are we considering one?

<!channel> check out the Friends slack channel "Friarbots" for next week's schedule and teams that need our help. Let me know who is going which days. Also, do we have any Freshman with FLL experience that would like to assist with mentoring?
<@U124VG02W> <@U2AU1J3J9> <@U2AUFT1C2> who's going to Friends today? And which campus? Brandon- if you are going you can ride with Karson. If you all three are going you should split up and going to both campuses. It would be good to post a message to Mrs Colby on slack so she knows who to expect and where. 
<@U2AU08KK9> has joined the channel
I will be going today. 
<@U124VG02W> <@U2AU1J3J9> <@U2AUFT1C2>  are you going to a Friends tomorrow?
